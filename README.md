# Stopwatch Web Application

Welcome to the **PRODIGY_WD_02** repository! As part of my web development internship, I've built a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are the key features:

1. **Stopwatch Functionality:**
   - Start, pause, restart and reset the stopwatch.
   - Accurately track and display lap times.
   - Measure and record time intervals with precision.

2. **Code Files:**
   - `index.html`: The structure of the stopwatch interface.
   - `watch.css`: Styling for an appealing user experience.
   - `watch.js`: Implements stopwatch logic.
